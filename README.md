## üßë‚Äçüíº Project Overview

The internship was divided into two core analytical tasks:

---

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Telemetry Data Analysis (Factory Machine Breakdowns)

**Objective:**  
Analyze unified telemetry data from four factories to identify:

1. Which factory experienced the most machine breakdowns  
2. Which specific machines were most problematic in that location

**Approach:**  
- Parsed and processed a large JSON dataset using Excel  
- Aggregated breakdown messages by location and machine type  
- Identified the factory with the highest breakdown frequency  
- Visualized machine breakdowns using bar charts

**Skills Applied:**  
`Data Cleaning`, `JSON Parsing`, `Exploratory Analysis`, `Aggregation`, `Visualization`, `Excel`

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Classification

**Objective:**  
Classify job roles based on their gender equality score using a company-provided dataset.

**Dataset:**  
A pre-processed Excel file containing:
- `Factory`
- `Job Role`
- `Equality Score` (from -100 to +100)

**Task:**  
Create a new column: `Equality Class`, based on the following logic:
- **Fair**: Between -10 and +10  
- **Unfair**: Less than -10 or greater than 10  
- **Highly Discriminative**: Less than -20 or greater than 20

**Approach:**  
- Wrote Excel formulas to classify scores into defined categories  
- Verified logic with multiple test cases  
- Ensured clean formatting and ready-to-upload data

**Skills Applied:**  
`Conditional Logic`, `Excel Formulas`, `Data Classification`, `Business Interpretation`
